Dietary fat strongly correlates with breast and other cancers[6],[49]–[51] but, similar to heart disease, these correlations occur for total and saturated fats, not for unsaturated fat,[52] thus favoring an association of these cancers with animal-based foods. Also, among these countries, dietary fat and animal protein consumption are highly correlated,[53] thus the observed association of these cancers with dietary fat could just as easily be an association with animal protein. Indeed, in a survey of 37 countries, the correlations of animal protein and saturated fat with breast and colon cancer exceeded those with socio-economic factors that typically characterize Western societies.[54] Similarly, in rural China, affluent cancers are much less common than in the U.S.[53] In these areas, dietary animal protein consumption is only about 10% that in the U.S. and mean plasma cholesterol [a surrogate for more animal and less plant protein consumption and the variable that is mainly correlated with this aggregate group of cancers and other affluent diseases (P < 0.001)] is only 127 mg/dL.[54] This is an impressive finding in an environment with such low statistical sensitivity."

In turn, a landscape that produces a healthier mix of crops and livestock for local and regional markets can have positive effects—not only in improved nutrition and health for consumers but also in the form of significant benefits for the environment and farm country's local economies. ... Together, cereal grains and oilseeds represent 59 percent of U.S. crop acreage while vegetables, fruits, and nuts account for only 2 percent. ... This distribution of cropland is incentivized by farm policies that provide subsidies forfarmers to grow select nonperishable 'commodity' crops e.g., corn and soybeans. Moreover, farmers who receive such subsidies are prohibited from planting any acreage with fruits and vegetables (unless certain highly prescribed conditions are met). In addition, the insurance program administered and subsidized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is oriented toward farmers who grow a handful of subsidized commodity crops, often leaving many fruit and vegetable farmers (particularly those growing a variety of crops) without access to adequate insurance and thus poorly positioned to obtain needed credit ... Our analysis found that if Americans consumed just one additional serving of fruits or vegetables each day, we would prevent 30,000 deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke annually and save $5 billion in national health care expenditures; if Americans went a step further and ate enough fruits and vegetables to fully meet federal dietary guidelines, we would prevent 127,000 such deaths each year and save $17 billion in medical costs."

Nevertheless, due to the increase in fecal bulk, the actual concentrations of fecal bile acids were lowest on the vegetable diet (1.2 mg/g wet weight, P =.002). Maximum lipid reductions occurred within 1 week. Urinary mevalonic acid excretion increased (P =.036) on the high-vegetable diet reflecting large fecal steroid losses. We conclude that very high-vegetable fiber intakes reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease and possibly colon cancer. Vegetable and fruit fibers therefore warrant further detailed investigation."

Polyphenol berry fruit juice consumption was most beneficial for immediate verbal memory, whereas isoflavone based interventions were associated with significant improvements for delayed spatial memory and executive function. Comparison between studies was hampered by methodological inconsistencies. Hence, there was no clear evidence for an association between cognitive outcomes and polyphenol dose response, duration of intervention, or population studied.

Industry representatives used certain tactics to oppose the fat tax: threatening lawsuits, predicting welfare losses, casting doubt on evidence, diverting focus and requesting postponement. After the fat tax was implemented, the food industry continued their opposition through intensified lobbyism and juridical actions at EU level. However, other factors seem to have contributed to the fall of the fat tax. The tax received criticism for being poorly designed and gradually lost popularity among health professionals, politicians and the public. In the end, the fat tax was abolished for financial reasons. This study demonstrates how politicians considered the fat tax as a funding source rather than a public health initiative, which resulted in significant shortcomings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the massive influence by industry stakeholders was not balanced with inputs from public health professionals, who should assume a more proactive role in policy-making"

A host of vested corporate interests—the sugar, alcohol, and tobacco industries, along with restaurants and advertisers—can make common cause around slippery slope concerns. All of these groups stand to lose if health is placed at the center of public policy. Slippery slope arguments should be approached with suspicion, as they force a speculative analysis without any specifics about the policy feared to lie downslope, or the likelihood of its being manifest. The task of policy-makers is to delineate which policies are acceptable and which are not. Their adoption of any given policy does not suggest that they will extend the same reasoning in other realms.

For a growing population, our calculations suggest that the only way to eat a nutritionally balanced diet, save land and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to consume and produce more fruits and vegetables as well as transition to diets higher in plant-based protein.

We analyse several options for reducing the environmental effects of the food system, including dietary changes towards healthier, more plant-based diets, improvements in technologies and management, and reductions in food loss and waste. We find that no single measure is enough to keep these effects within all planetary boundaries simultaneously, and that a synergistic combination of measures will be needed to sufficiently mitigate the projected increase in environmental pressures."

The ERbeta expressed in osteoblasts may mediate the reported beneficial impact of soy isoflavones on bone metabolism. Suggestive evidence that soy-rich diets decrease prostate cancer risk, accords well with the observation that ERbeta appears to play an antiproliferative role in healthy prostate. In the breast, ERalpha promotes epithelial proliferation, whereas ERbeta has a restraining influence in this regard - consistent with the emerging view that soy isoflavones do not increase breast cancer risk, and possibly may diminish it. Premenopausal women enjoy a relative protection from kidney failure; since ERbeta is an antagonist of TGF-beta signaling in mesangial cells, soy isoflavones may have nephroprotective potential. Estrogen also appears to protect women from left ventricular hypertrophy, and recent evidence suggests that this effect is mediated by ERbeta. In conjunction with reports that isoflavones may have a modestly beneficial impact on menopausal symptoms - perhaps reflecting the presence of ERbeta in the hypothalamus - these considerations suggest that soy isoflavone regimens of sufficient potency may represent a safe and moderately effective alternative to HRT in postmenopausal women.

We found that the anthropometric patterns of children fed SIF were similar to those of children fed CMF [cow's milk-based formula] or HM [human milk substitute]. Despite the high levels of phytates and aluminium in SIF, Hb, serum protein, Zn and Ca concentrations and bone mineral content were found to be similar to those of children fed CMF or HM. We also found the levels of genistein and daidzein to be higher in children fed SIF; however, we did not find strong evidence of a negative effect on reproductive and endocrine functions. Immune measurements and neurocognitive parameters were similar in all the feeding groups. In conclusion, modern SIF are evidence-based safety options to feed children requiring them. The patterns of growth, bone health and metabolic, reproductive, endocrine, immune and neurological functions are similar to those observed in children fed CMF or HM."

Epidemiological studies suggest that foodstuffs containing phytoestrogens may have a beneficial role in protecting against a number of chronic diseases and conditions. For cancer of the prostate, colon, rectum, stomach and lung, the evidence is most consistent for a protective effect resulting from a high intake of grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables; it is not possible to identify particular food types or components that may be responsible. Dietary intervention studies indicate that in women soya and linseed may have beneficial effects on the risk of breast cancer and may help to alleviate postmenopausal symptoms. For osteoporosis, tentative evidence suggests phytoestrogens may have similar effects in maintaining bone density to those of the related pharmaceutical compound ipriflavone. Soya also appears to have beneficial effects on blood lipids which may help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. Generally, however, little evidence exists to link these effects directly to phytoestrogens; many other components of soya and linseed are biologically active in various experimental systems and may be responsible for the observed effects in humans."

The global average water footprint of chicken egg is 3 300 m 3 /ton, while the water footprint of cow milk amounts to 1000 m 3 /ton. Per ton of product, animal products generally have a larger water footprint than crop products. The same is true when we look at the water footprint per calorie. The average water footprint per calorie for beef is twenty times larger than for cereals and starchy roots. When we look at the water requirements for protein, it has been found that the water footprint per gram of protein for milk, eggs and chicken meat is about 1.5 times larger than for pulses. For beef, the water footprint per gram of protein is 6 times larger than for pulses. In the case of fat, butter has a relatively small water footprint per gram of fat, even lower than for oil crops. All other animal products, however, have larger water footprints per gram of fat when compared to oil crops. From a freshwater resource perspective, it is more efficient to obtain calories, protein and fat through crop products than animal products. ... Global animal production requires about 2422 Gm 3 of water per year (87.2% green, 6.2% blue, 6.6% grey water). One third of this volume is for the beef cattle sector; another 19% for the dairy cattle sector. Most of the total volume of water (98%) refers to the water footprint of the feed for the animals. Drinking water for the animals, service water and feed mixing water account only for 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.03%, respectively."
